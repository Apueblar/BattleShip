# BattleShip
This is a simple game called BattleShip. In it, you can strategically try to guess the locations of your opponent's ships. The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.

## About the Game
Battleship is a classic two-player game where each player has a fleet of ships placed randomly on a hidden grid. Players take turns calling out grid coordinates to "attack" the opponent's ships. If a player correctly guesses a coordinate containing part of a ship, it is marked as a "hit"; otherwise, it is a "miss". The game continues until one player sinks all of the opponent's ships.

## Project Overview
This project is a Java implementation of the Battleship game, created for a class assignment. The game includes features such as:

- A command-line interface for gameplay
- Randomized ship placement for both players
- Turn-based gameplay mechanics
- A simple AI opponent for solo play

## How to Play
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Compile the Java code using a Java compiler.
Run the game from the command line.
Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns attacking the opponent.

## Installation
To run the game, ensure you have Java installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/Apueblar/battleship.git
cd battleship
javac Battleship.java
java Battleship

## Future Enhancements (unlikely)
Planned improvements for this project include:

- A graphical user interface (GUI)
- Enhanced AI with multiple difficulty levels
- Multiplayer support over a network
